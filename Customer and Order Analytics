#In the SQL below, I am querying a database with multiple tables in order to evaluate the customer and order data

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'



#2 How many orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
AND Product = 'iPhone'
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT(acctnum) 
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#4 Which product was the cheapest sold in the month of January and what was it's price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5 What is the total revenue generated for each product sold in July?

FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6 Which products were sold in February at the address 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total reveunue?

SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product


#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
